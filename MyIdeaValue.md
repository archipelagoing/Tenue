# Sillage
## Verified Fragrance Identity Network

Sillage is a digital identity network where fragrance ownership becomes verifiable, social, and expressive.

It allows users to scan their perfume bottles, verify ownership, join scent-based communities ("villages"), and discover others through shared fragrance identity.

Sillage transforms fragrance from a private sensory experience into a visible, structured identity layer.

# Core Idea

Luxury fragrance is not just about smell.

It is about identity, taste, belonging, and self-expression.

However, fragrance identity currently exists in isolation. There is no system that allows users to:

- Verify and track authentic fragrance ownership
- Express fragrance as part of their digital identity
- Discover others with similar scent identity
- Form communities based on shared fragrance ownership
- Navigate fragrance culture as a connected network

Sillage solves this by creating the first verified fragrance identity network.

# How It Works

## Step 1: User Creates a Profile

The user creates a Sillage profile.

This profile represents their fragrance identity.

---

## Step 2: User Scans a QR Code on Their Perfume Bottle

Each participating fragrance includes a unique QR code.

The user scans this QR code using the Sillage app.

This scan:

- Confirms the fragrance is authentic
- Links ownership of the fragrance to the user's profile

This creates a verified ownership record.

---

## Step 3: Digital Ownership Certificate Is Created

After scanning, a digital certificate of ownership is generated.

This certificate includes:

- Fragrance name
- Brand
- Ownership timestamp
- Unique verification identifier

This certificate serves as proof of authentic ownership.

Blockchain infrastructure may be used as a backend verification layer to ensure authenticity and permanence.

This verification layer is invisible to the user and functions as infrastructure.

---

## Step 4: User Is Added to the Fragrance’s Village

Each fragrance has an associated community called a "village".

A village is a group of users who share ownership of the same fragrance.

For example:

Village: Very Good Girl — Caroline Herrera  
Village: Santal 33 — Le Labo  
Village: Bleu de Chanel — Chanel  

When a user verifies ownership, they automatically join that fragrance’s village.

Villages allow users to discover others who share their fragrance identity.

---

## Step 5: System Builds the User’s Fragrance Identity Signature

Most users own multiple fragrances.

The system aggregates verified ownership into a structured identity model.

This creates a Fragrance Identity Signature.

This signature reflects:

- Identity patterns
- Taste clusters
- Cultural alignment
- Community overlap

This identity becomes part of the user’s digital presence.

---

## Step 6: Recommendation Engine Learns Identity Patterns

The system analyzes anonymized fragrance ownership data across users.

This allows the system to learn relationships between fragrances and identity clusters.

Using this data, Sillage can recommend:

- New fragrances aligned with identity
- New villages to explore
- New communities to join

This recommendation engine functions similarly to Spotify or Netflix recommendation systems, but operates on fragrance identity instead of media consumption.

---

## Step 7: Social and Community Layer

Users can explore villages and discover others with similar fragrance identity.

This creates scent-based communities.

Users can:

- Discover others who share their fragrance identity
- Explore fragrance communities
- Express identity through fragrance ownership
- Navigate scent culture as a social network

Fragrance becomes a visible social signal.

---

## Step 8: Cultural and Trend Intelligence Layer (Future Expansion)

As the network grows, anonymized and aggregated data can reveal cultural fragrance patterns.

This may include:

- Rising fragrance communities
- Emerging identity clusters
- Cultural shifts in fragrance preference

This creates a living cultural map of fragrance identity.

---

# Core Concepts

## Verified Ownership

Ownership of fragrance is verified and recorded as a digital certificate.

This ensures authenticity and identity integrity.

---

## Villages

Villages are communities formed around shared fragrance ownership.

Villages are the core unit of social structure in the network.

---

## Fragrance Identity Signature

Each user has a unique fragrance identity signature based on verified ownership.

This signature represents their scent identity.

---

## Identity Graph

Sillage builds a graph connecting:

User → Fragrance → Village → Other Users

This creates a navigable identity network.

---

# Why This Matters

Luxury fragrance is currently limited to physical ownership and private experience.

Sillage transforms fragrance into:

- A verifiable identity signal
- A social connector
- A digital identity component
- A network structure

This protects luxury fragrance from commodification and duplication by shifting value from the physical product to the identity graph.

---

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP includes:

- User profile creation
- QR code scanning for fragrance verification
- Digital ownership record creation
- Village assignment per fragrance
- Viewing other users in the same village

This establishes the fragrance identity network.

---

# Vision

Sillage aims to become the identity layer for fragrance.

Just as LinkedIn maps professional identity and Spotify maps music identity, Sillage maps scent identity.

Fragrance becomes:

- Verifiable
- Social
- Navigable
- Expressive

Sillage transforms fragrance from an object into an identity network.
